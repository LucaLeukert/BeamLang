# Agent Instructions

- Follow the BeamLang design document (`beamlang_design.md`) and keep implementations minimal unless requested otherwise.
- Prefer compiling BeamLang to BEAM bytecode via Erlang abstract forms.
- Use the new `@spec` feature in BeamLang examples and compiler-related documentation where applicable.
